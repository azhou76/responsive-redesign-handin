    <h1>Overview:</h1>
    <p>
      Students at Brown University are constantly searching for the next
      restaurants to try out around the Providence area. Oftentimes, a website
      that properly shows off the best dishes a restaurant has to offer can be
      the deciding factor as to whether potential patrons choose to dine at the
      restaurant or not.
    </p>
    <h1>Chosen Webpage:</h1>
    <p>Soban Korean Eatery</p>
    <p>https://www.sobankoreaneatery.com/</p>
    <img src="assets/original.png" alt="" />
    <p>
      With many of the popular Providence restaurants already having a
      professionally designed website, I felt that Soban Korean Eatery, a local
      restaurant located on Thayer Street, lacked the same sophisticated and
      modern website. As a regular customer at Soban, I was intrigued by the
      opportunity to redesign their website.
    </p>
    <h3>Usability Problems:</h1>
    <p>
      Although the website was, overall, fairly usable, there were a few issues
      that I noticed when navigating the site:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Problem with learnability as there are no clear indicators as to how to
        go about making a reservation at the restaurant via the website
      </li>
      <li>
        Problem with memorability as the website doesn't clearly point users in
        the direction of their menu in the navbar (as do most restaurants'
        sites)
      </li>
      <li>
        Problem with efficiency as the majority of their homepage includes giant
        blocks of text that users have to read through
      </li>
      <li>
        Problem with efficiency as the website only includes images of their
        most famous dishes in a separate photo gallery tab, rather than in high
        visibility positions on their homepage (with the exception of the one
        dish at the top)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Accessibility Problems:</h1>
    <p>
      For the most part, the current Soban website performed fairly well on
      accessibility softwares, including scoring an accessibility rating of 93
      via a Lighthouse report. When using WebAIM WAVE, the primary errors it
      pointed out were related to missing form labels for the “Contact Us” form
      submission located in the footer of the homepage. I agree with these
      accessibility concerns because by not having proper HTML labels on the
      form's input lines, screen readers will have a more difficult time
      conveying the hierarchical HTML structure of the website to potential
      visually impaired users.
    </p>
    <h1>Sketches:</h1>
    <p>
      The first step of the redesign process was to draw speed sketches
      encompassing nine distinct design ideas and then synthesize the best parts
      of each of them into a final sketch that would serve as the basis for the
      Lo-Fi and Hi-Fi Figma designs.
    </p>
    <h3>Speed Sketches (9):</h1>
    <div class="images">
      <img src="assets/speed-sketches.png" alt="" />
    </div>
    <h3>Final Sketch:</h1>
    <img src="assets/final-sketch.png" alt="" />
    <h1>Lo-Fi Wireframes:</h1>
    <p>
      The initial Figma renderings of the Lo-Fi wireframes (without colors) took
      on the task of how to adjust the desktop design to still be a suitable UI
      on smaller tablet and phone screens.
    </p>
    <h3>Desktop View:</h3>
    <img src="assets/lofi-desktop.png" alt="" />
    <h3>Tablet View:</h3>
    <img src="assets/lofi-tablet.png" alt="" />
    <h3>Phone View:</h3>
    <img src="assets/lofi-phone.png" alt="" />
    <h1>Style Guide:</h1>
    <p>
      The next step of the redesign process was to come up with the exact
      colors, font families, and buttons/icons that would replace the
      black-and-white Lo-Fi renderings. A visual design style guide was created
      with this information to better inform the creation of the Hi-Fi mockups.
    </p>
    <img src="assets/style-guide.png" alt="" />
    <h1>Hi-Fi Mockups:</h1>
    <p>
      The style guide elements were finally then applied to the Lo-Fi wireframes
      to create Hi-Fi mockups that would closely resemble the final redesigned
      website. Mockups were similarly created for the three primary screen sizes
      (desktop, tablet, and phone).
    </p>
    <h3>Desktop View:</h3>
    <img src="assets/hifi-desktop.png" alt="" />
    <h3>Tablet View:</h3>
    <img src="assets/hifi-tablet.png" alt="" />
    <h3>Phone View:</h3>
    <img src="assets/hifi-phone.png" alt="" />
    <h1>Responsive Redesign:</h1>

    <p>
      Lastly, the Hi-Fi Figma mockups were translated into a responsive website
      using HTML and CSS and deployed using GitHub pages. Media queries and aria
      labels were used to improve responsiveness and accessibility,
      respectively, and extensive testing using Developer Tools was performed to
      ensure all screen sizes in the range of phone screens to larger computers
      could adequately serve the website's design. Finally, WebAIM WAVE and
      Lighthouse were used to ensure proper accessibility within the redesigned
      website. The redesigned website scored similarly to the original in terms
      of its Lighthouse score, and it had fewer errors than the original when
      using WAVE.
    </p>
    <h1>Takeaways:</h1>
    <p>
      Although, oftentimes, there is a heavy emphasis by software engineers to
      have a very clean desktop view of a website, early-stage testing and
      designing is critical to ensuring that people accessing the mobile version
      of the website can still use and leverage the various components the
      website has to offer. Having never really used Figma to guide a website
      redesign before, I found that having this reference when actually coding
      the website was an incredibly helpful guide that made the programming
      phase significantly easier and more streamlined. Furthermore, this
      exercise allowed me to also compare and contrast the aspects of a
      restaurant's website that I felt were essential to include in high
      visibility locations and what items were non-essential for the homepage.
      Overall, I am more aware of how users view a website's usability, which is
      sometimes the opposite of how a developer views it.
